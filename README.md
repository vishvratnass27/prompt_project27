# Chatbot App with OpenAI GPT-3

## Overview

This Python application uses the OpenAI GPT-3 language model to create a chatbot that can engage in conversations with users. The chatbot responds to user inputs, making it suitable for various conversational applications.

## Requirements

Before running the code, you need to set up your OpenAI API key. Replace `"Enter your OpenAI key"` in the code with your actual API key.

Additionally, make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- tkinter: For creating the graphical user interface (GUI).
- openai: To access the OpenAI GPT-3 model.

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install tkinter openai
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project folder.

2. Replace `"Enter your OpenAI key"` in the code with your OpenAI API key.

3. Run the Python script to start the Chatbot App.

   ```bash
   python chatbot_app.py
   ```

4. The app will open, allowing you to have conversations with the chatbot. Type your message in the input box and click the "Send" button to receive responses.

## How It Works

- The app uses the `tkinter` library to create a simple GUI with a text input box and a chat log display.

- User messages are sent to the OpenAI GPT-3 model using the `chat_with_gpt` function, which returns chatbot responses.

- Chatbot responses are displayed in the chat log.

## Customization

You can customize the chatbot's behavior by modifying the `prompt` and `Messages` variables in the code. Adjust the conversation format and system prompts to suit your needs.

## Conclusion

This Chatbot App demonstrates how to integrate the OpenAI GPT-3 model into a simple GUI application for interactive conversations. You can use this code as a foundation to build more sophisticated chatbot applications.

Feel free to explore and modify the code to create chatbots tailored to your specific use cases.
