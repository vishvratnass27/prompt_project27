# Chatbot App with OpenAI GPT-3

## Overview

This Python application uses the OpenAI GPT-3 language model to create a chatbot that can engage in conversations with users. The chatbot responds to user inputs, making it suitable for various conversational applications.

## Requirements

Before running the code, you need to set up your OpenAI API key. Replace `"Enter your OpenAI key"` in the code with your actual API key.

Additionally, make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- tkinter: For creating the graphical user interface (GUI).
- openai: To access the OpenAI GPT-3 model.

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install tkinter openai
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project folder.

2. Replace `"Enter your OpenAI key"` in the code with your OpenAI API key.

3. Run the Python script to start the Chatbot App.

   ```bash
   python chatbot_app.py
   ```

4. The app will open, allowing you to have conversations with the chatbot. Type your message in the input box and click the "Send" button to receive responses.

## How It Works

- The app uses the `tkinter` library to create a simple GUI with a text input box and a chat log display.

- User messages are sent to the OpenAI GPT-3 model using the `chat_with_gpt` function, which returns chatbot responses.

- Chatbot responses are displayed in the chat log.
##explanation
  Certainly! This code is a simple GUI (Graphical User Interface) application built using the Tkinter library in Python. It allows you to chat with OpenAI's GPT-3 model by entering text messages.

Let's break down the code step by step:

1. Importing Libraries:
   - `import tkinter as tk`: This imports the Tkinter library, which is used for creating the graphical interface.
   - `import openai`: This imports the OpenAI library, which is used to communicate with the GPT-3 model.

2. Setting OpenAI API Key:
   - `mykey = "please enter your openai key"`: Replace `"please enter your openai key"` with your actual OpenAI API key. This key is required to access the GPT-3 model.
   - `openai.api_key = mykey`: Sets your API key for OpenAI.

3. `chat_with_gpt` Function:
   - This function takes two parameters, `prompt` (system message) and `Messages` (user message).
   - It sends a conversation prompt to the GPT-3 model and receives a response.
   - The conversation includes a system message (like a setup) and a user message.
   - The response from the GPT-3 model is extracted and returned.

4. `send_message` Function:
   - This function is called when the user clicks the "Send" button.
   - It retrieves the user's input from the text box and adds it to the chat log.
   - It then appends the user's input to the conversation prompt and calls `chat_with_gpt` to get a response from the GPT-3 model.
   - Finally, it displays the chatbot's response in the chat log.

5. Creating the GUI:
   - The code creates the main application window using `tk.Tk()`.
   - It sets the window's title to "Chatbot App" using `window.title("Chatbot App")`.

6. Chat Log Display:
   - `chat_log` is a text widget where the chat conversation is displayed. It's created with a specific height and width and packed into the window.

7. User Input Text Box:
   - `user_input_text` is a text widget where the user can enter messages. It's created with a smaller height and width and packed into the window.

8. Send Button:
   - `send_button` is a button widget with the label "Send." When clicked, it triggers the `send_message` function.
   - It's also packed into the window.

9. Application Loop:
   - `window.mainloop()` starts the main event loop of the Tkinter application, which keeps the GUI running and responsive.

When you run this code, you'll see a window with a chat log, an input box, and a "Send" button. You can type messages in the input box, click "Send," and the chatbot will respond with messages generated by the GPT-3 model. This allows you to have a conversation with the chatbot in a graphical interface.

## Conclusion

This Chatbot App demonstrates how to integrate the OpenAI GPT-3 model into a simple GUI application for interactive conversations. You can use this code as a foundation to build more sophisticated chatbot applications.
